I am a machine learning researcher at Huawei Technologies, affected at the Ireland Intelligent Operation & Management Lab.

I am interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. Currently, I am working on building efficient and explainable machine learning models to help achieve the Autonomous Driving Network (ADN).

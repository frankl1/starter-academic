abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in many NLP applications that seek to identify and classify expressions such as people, location, and organization names. Many NER systems have been developed, but the annotated data needed for learning is not available for low-resource languages, such as Cameroonian languages. In this paper we exploit the low frequency of named entities in text to define a new suitable word representation for named entity recognition. We build the first Ewondo (a Bantu language of Cameroon) named entities recognizer by projecting named entity tags from English using our word representation. In terms of Recall, Precision and F-score, the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed word representation.

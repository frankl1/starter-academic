title: "Taekwondo Kicks Prediction Using Time Series of Poses"
summary: "In this project, we built a machine learning framework to accurately recognize taekwondo moves. Each moves is modelled as a time series of poses. The poses are captured with the help of the PoseNet deep neural network running on a mobile phone. Once the poses are captured, they are sent to a remote server which performs the move prediction and return the results to the phone."
